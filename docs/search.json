    "text": "About\n\nHi I’m Luke, a master’s student in statistics, aspiring statistical arbitrage researcher, and hopefully a future PhD student in statistics.\nMy academic interests are probability theory, stochastic processes, time series analysis, and simulations.\nMy current goals are to gain research experience, pass PhD qualifying exams in Summer 2025, and increase my overall mathematical maturity.\nSome of my hobbies are playing video games and volleyball. Recently I’ve been playing Pokemon Go.\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n Rutgers University | New Brunswick, NJ\n\nM.S. in Statistics | September 2024 - Present\n\nFinancial Statistics and Risk Management Program and Completing First Year PhD Requirements.\nCurrent Courses: Measure Theoretic Probability (PhD), Mathematical Statistics (PhD), Applied Statistical Methods I (PhD), Foundations of Risk Management\nFuture Courses: Stochastic Processes (PhD), Statistical Inference (PhD), Applied Statistical Methods II (PhD), Time Series Analysis, Data Mining\n\n\n\nB.A. in Statistics and Mathematics | September 2020 - May 2024\n\nMinor and Certificate in Data Science\nCourses: Machine Learning Principles, Probability Theory, Stochastic Processes, Mathematical Statistics, Regression Methods, Multivariate Analysis, Numerical Analysis, and Bayesian Statistics\nParticipated in the quantitative finance club, taekwondo club, and K-Pop dance club\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\n MarketAxess | Quantitative Research Intern (Python, SQL) | June 2024 - August 2024\nPersonal Project: I researched the effects that a trading strategy has on bond pricing, trade execution, and market impact. I also tested different benchmarks that can be used for testing such strategies and analyzed how dealers respond to these strategies.\nGroup Project: Other interns and I wire-framed the implementation of a pricing model into a new market and how it would benefit automation in that market. I personally analyzed the demand for automation and compared the accuracy between a proprietary model and competitor model.\n\n\n\n Crum & Forster | Data Science Intern (R, SQL) | May 2023 - November 2023\nResearch & Development Team: I worked on several projects including analysis of vendor data to find useful predictors for a pricing model, revamping of other Shiny applications to provide quality of life changes and implement new features, and developing of an API to streamline vendor data retrieval and feature engineering for use in a pricing model.\nActuarial Pricing Team: I developed an R Shiny application that calculates actuarial metrics, key performance indicators, and automates data analysis for actuaries and other insurance personnel. The application connects to several databases gets automatically updated daily with fresh data. This gives actuaries the freedom to focus on more granular levels of data instead of having to worry about data querying, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and metric calculation at the higher department and line of business levels.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nThanks for checking out my website!"

    "text": "Ongoing\n\nMachine Learning from Scratch in R\nAs statistics curriculum tend to focus on some theory and then application of models through functions in R (or Python), students such as myself overlook the algorithm and math that drives the functions. Through this project, my goal is to learn about all the necessary math behind the machine learning models that are taught in school and implement them in R from scratch. To do this, I am reading the free online books An Introduction to Statistical Learning and Advanced R , which has allowed me to learn more about how and why the models work, how to calculate the parameter significance, and how to program in the R6 object oriented programming framework in R.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithmic Stock Trading\nIn this project, I am leveraging a brokerage’s API to develop infrastructure to automate trading, back-test strategies, and analyze real-time data. The goal is to have a framework where I can seamlessly implement and test any strategy as well as try to develop some strategies of my own. Currently, I am pulling daily stock data for every ticker, filtering to pairs that have large correlations, and then testing for cointegration. I will back test pairs trading on potential pairs. Unfortunately, this project is currently on hold do to lack of ram."
