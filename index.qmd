### About

-- --
 
Hi I'm Luke, a master's student in statistics, aspiring statistical arbitrage researcher, and hopefully a future PhD student in statistics. \
My academic interests are probability theory, stochastic processes, time series analysis, and simulations. \
My current goals are to gain research experience, pass PhD qualifying exams in Summer 2025, and increase my overall mathematical maturity. \
Some of my hobbies are playing video games and volleyball. Recently I've been playing Pokemon Go.

### Experience

##### ![](img/ma_logo.jpg){.center} **MarketAxess** \| *Quantitative Research Intern (Python, SQL)* \| June 2024 - August 2024

**Personal Project:** I researched the effects that a trading strategy has on bond pricing, trade execution, and market impact. I also tested different benchmarks that can be used for testing such strategies and analyzed how dealers respond to these strategies.

**Group Project:** Other interns and I wire-framed the implementation of a pricing model into a new market and how it would benefit automation in that market. I personally analyzed the demand for automation and compared the accuracy between a proprietary model and competitor model.

##### ![](img/crum.png){.center} **Crum & Forster** \| *Data Science Intern (R, SQL)* \| May 2023 - November 2023

**Research & Development Team:** I worked on several projects including analysis of vendor data to find useful predictors for a pricing model, revamping of other Shiny applications to provide quality of life changes and implement new features, and developing of an API to streamline vendor data retrieval and feature engineering for use in a pricing model.

**Actuarial Pricing Team:** I developed an R Shiny application that calculates actuarial metrics, key performance indicators, and automates data analysis for actuaries and other insurance personnel. The application connects to several databases gets automatically updated daily with fresh data. This gives actuaries the freedom to focus on more granular levels of data instead of having to worry about data querying, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and metric calculation at the higher department and line of business levels.
